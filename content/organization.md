## Creating a Github Organization

Github allows for users to set up organizations where you can place material without it being all in your own github repository. This allows for some nice functionality:

- Separates out personal content from your organization or class materials. 
- Allows for additional administrators to have full access to repos. 
- Allows for easy transfer of ownership.
